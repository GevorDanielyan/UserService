This is the simple web api created via ASP.NET Core.


## Steps

1. First of all, you need to setup docker for your machine. https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Then you need to pull database image from docker hub. 
```bash
  docker pull gevdanielyan/db_user_information:sqlcust
```
3. After that, you can create container based on that image. Set container name sqlCustom, and port 1433.
